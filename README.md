# UFO Sightings

## Project Overview
This project allows users to filter a large data set of UFO sightings using filters on a web page. The project included building javascript to filter the data when parameters are changed by the user, and automatically update the table in the HTML file. A CSS file was also used to make the web page visually appealing.

## Results
When you open the page, results from all sightings will appear as pictured below(Image 1). On the left are filters, and you can update your search criteria by date, state, city, and shape of the sighting. Once you input information in the filter, you will immediately see the filtered results, as pictured below in the second image(Image 2).

## Summary
One drawback of this design is the user may have to do a lot of trial and error to filter for the results. Some recommended improvements include adding drop down filters to select for states, cities and countries where there have been sightings as well as a drop down for the different shapes. I'd also recommend a drop down for the month and years of the sightings that are present to make it easier to search.
